# Issue #3: CRITICAL Weak Encryption Implementation

**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/ortaizi/spike1/issues/3 **Severity**:
CRITICAL üî¥ **OWASP**: A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures **File**:
`/apps/web/lib/auth/encryption.ts:57-68, 108-115`

## Problem Analysis

The encryption.ts file contains critical cryptographic vulnerabilities:

### Primary Issues:

1. **Using deprecated `crypto.createCipher`** instead of `crypto.createCipheriv`
2. **Using deprecated `crypto.createDecipher`** instead of
   `crypto.createDecipheriv`
3. **IV (Initialization Vector) generated but never used** - IV is created on
   line 54 but ignored in encryption/decryption
4. **Predictable encryption patterns** - Without proper IV usage, same plaintext
   produces same ciphertext

### Vulnerable Code Locations:

```typescript
// Line 57 - VULNERABLE: Missing IV usage
const usernameCipher = crypto.createCipher(ALGORITHM, ENCRYPTION_KEY);

// Line 64 - VULNERABLE: Missing IV usage
const passwordCipher = crypto.createCipher(ALGORITHM, ENCRYPTION_KEY);

// Line 108 - VULNERABLE: Missing IV usage
const usernameDecipher = crypto.createDecipher(ALGORITHM, ENCRYPTION_KEY);

// Line 115 - VULNERABLE: Missing IV usage
const passwordDecipher = crypto.createDecipher(ALGORITHM, ENCRYPTION_KEY);
```

### Security Risks:

- **Cryptographic attacks** against predictable encryption patterns
- **Pattern analysis** revealing information about encrypted credentials
- **Credential compromise** if encryption is broken
- **OWASP A02:2021 violation** - Cryptographic failures

## Solution Plan

### Step 1: Fix Encryption Functions (Lines 57, 64)

- Replace `crypto.createCipher` with `crypto.createCipheriv`
- Use the generated IV (line 54) in encryption process
- Ensure IV is included in encrypted result

### Step 2: Fix Decryption Functions (Lines 108, 115)

- Replace `crypto.createDecipher` with `crypto.createDecipheriv`
- Use the stored IV from encrypted data
- Ensure proper IV handling in decryption process

### Step 3: Comprehensive Testing

- Test encryption/decryption round-trip functionality
- Verify existing test suite passes
- Add specific tests for IV usage
- Validate against cryptographic best practices

### Step 4: Security Validation

- Run lint and type-check commands
- Verify no other cryptographic vulnerabilities
- Test with real credentials in development environment

## Implementation Steps

1. ‚úÖ **ANALYSIS COMPLETE**: Identified all vulnerable code locations
2. üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**: Create detailed plan document
3. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Create new branch for security fix
4. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Fix encryption functions with proper IV usage
5. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Fix decryption functions with proper IV usage
6. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Write comprehensive tests
7. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Manual testing of encryption functionality
8. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Run full test suite
9. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Code quality checks (lint, type-check)
10. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Commit with security fix message
11. ‚è≥ **PENDING**: Open PR for security review

## Technical Details

### Current Algorithm: AES-256-GCM

- **Good**: Using AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Bad**: Not using IV properly with createCipheriv/createDecipheriv
- **Risk**: Predictable encryption without proper IV usage

### Required Changes:

```typescript
// BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
const usernameCipher = crypto.createCipher(ALGORITHM, ENCRYPTION_KEY);

// AFTER (SECURE):
const usernameCipher = crypto.createCipheriv(ALGORITHM, ENCRYPTION_KEY, iv);
```

### IV Handling:

- IV is already generated (line 54): `const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);`
- IV is already stored (line 76): `iv: iv.toString('hex')`
- IV is already retrieved (line 105): `const ivBuffer = Buffer.from(iv, 'hex');`
- **Missing**: Actually using the IV in encryption/decryption calls

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify encryption/decryption with proper IV
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with real credential data
3. **Security Tests**: Verify different plaintexts produce different ciphertexts
4. **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing functionality works
5. **Manual Testing**: Test in development environment

## Priority: IMMEDIATE

This is a critical security vulnerability that must be fixed immediately. The
encryption system is currently vulnerable to cryptographic attacks that could
compromise user credentials.

**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Analysis complete, implementation starting
